This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You will need the following installed:
* nvm


First, run the following to install dependencies
```bash
nvm use

npm install
```

Then, build and run the development server:

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3001/api/](http://localhost:3000/api/)

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Testing project

```shell
npm test
```

## Deploy on Vercel

Depoy this Next.js app using [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
